# Lab 4

## Step 4

Keys pressed: <control> r ssh <enter>

Since I used the command ssh cs15lwi23aqw@ieng6.ucsd.edu before, I just typed control r to go to through the command history, then searched up ssh to access it, as it was the only command with ssh. Then I pressed enter to run the command. 

## Step 5

Keys pressed: git clone <command> v <enter>
  
There's not really any point for me to search up this command in the history, because it's a relatively short command, so I just copied the ssh clone from github. Then, I just typed git clone and pressed <command> v to paste the ssh clone URL.
