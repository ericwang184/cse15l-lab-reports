# Lab 4

## Step 4

Keys pressed: <control> r ssh <enter>

Since I used the command ssh cs15lwi23aqw@ieng6.ucsd.edu before, I just typed control r to go to through the command history, then searched up ssh to access it, as it was the only command with ssh. Then I pressed enter to run the command. 

## Step 5

Keys pressed: git clone <command> v <enter>
  
There's not really any point for me to search up this command in the history, because it's a relatively short command, so I just copied the ssh clone from github. Then, I just typed git clone and pressed <command> v to paste the ssh clone URL. 
  
## Step 6

Keys pressed: cd lab7 <enter> <control> r javac <enter> <control> r java <control> r <control> r <enter>
  
I first changed directory with the cd command to get to the lab7 directory, then I searched up the javac command using <control> r, because I did it before during the lab. After searching it up and compiling the testers, I then had to search up the run command for the testers. I searched up java using <control> r, but I had to press <control> r two more times, because the first two times led me to the compiling command that we already used in this step. The last <control> r showed the right command to run the test, and since I already ran the test in lab, the whole command is filled out with the java file we are testing with, which in this case is ListExamplesTest.
